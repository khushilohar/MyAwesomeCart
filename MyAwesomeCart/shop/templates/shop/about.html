      <h1 class="display-3">My Cart!</h1>
      <p>My Awesome Cart was founded in October 2007 in Mumbai by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees.[9][10][11] The company initially focused on online book sales with country-wide shipping. Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.[12]</p>

        <h2>Business structure</h2>
        <p>According to a report in November 2014, My Awesome Cart operated with a complex business structure that included nine firms, some registered in Singapore and some in India. In 2012, Flipkart co-founders sold WS Retail to a consortium of investors led by Rajeev Kuchhal.[99] Flipkart's Indian entities are owned by Flipkart Pvt. Ltd, which is registered in Singapore. The Singapore-registered entity owns eight Indian companies, including Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd, the company that runs the e-commerce marketplace Flipkart.com, Flipkart India Pvt. Ltd, the wholesale business, and Flipkart Logistics Pvt. Ltd, which runs Ekart (the internal logistics arm that can be used by other ecommerce players).[100][101] Flipkart also started Flipkart Health+ (through an app) in 2021 that deals into providing medicines and health services through technology. This was started with the help of getting majority share in Sastasundar Marketplace Limited - an existing company that already was providing online pharmacy services.[102] </p>

        <p>A group of scammers was arrested by the police in Lucknow in 2022 who used the platform to scam the customers. The scam included replacing the online ordered Apple products with bricks to cheat customers and company.[149] Such scams have also been reported in the past where soaps were delivered instead of iphones on Flipkart[150] and also on Amazon.[151][152]</p>

        <h2>House brands</h2>
        <p>Flipkart operates several house brands, including Citron[153] (home appliances) and Digiflip (formerly for electronics and accessories).[154] In 2017, Flipkart launched additional house brands, including Billion (smartphones),[155] Smartbuy (electronics accessories, effectively replacing Digiflip),[156] and MarQ (for large appliances, although its launch was complicated by a trademark dispute with an existing company, Marc Enterprises).[157]

In 2019, Flipkart began selling Nokia-brand televisions. A 55-inch, Android TV-based 4K Smart TV was the first product released under that licensing agreement.[158] A 43-inch TV was unveiled on 4 June 2020.[159]</p>
